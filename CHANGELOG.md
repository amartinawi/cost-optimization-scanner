# Changelog

All notable changes to the AWS Cost Optimization Scanner project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.4.0] - 2026-05-14

### Removed (Cost-Only Scope Refinement)
- **40+ non-cost-saving findings purged across 24 service modules**. The scanner is now strictly a cost-optimization tool — every emitted recommendation must produce a concrete account-specific $ saving. Removed: health / state checks (DEGRADED add-ons, inactive node groups, replication lag monitors), best-practice nudges (Fargate adoption, Aurora Serverless v2 migration, "consider Graviton" without instance pricing), version-upgrade prompts (Old Redis / Elasticsearch / OpenSearch versions), monitoring-enablement directives (Container Insights, CloudWatch detailed monitoring, DLM), $0/month findings with "quantify after X" tails, and percentage-range estimates with no per-account baseline. Specifically:
  - `services/ec2.py`: Monitoring Required, Auto Scaling Missing, Burstable Instance Optimization (no metrics), Stopped Instances housekeeping, Static ASGs (EKS + non-EKS), Non-Prod 24/7 ASGs, Missing Scale-In Policies, Monitoring-Only Instances.
  - `services/rds.py`: io1/io2/gp3 IOPS review, Stopped-database housekeeping, Burstable Instance Rightsizing (no metrics), Aurora Serverless v2 migration nudge (instance + cluster), Aurora I/O-Optimized "review".
  - `services/elasticache.py`: Old Engine Version (Redis < 7 upgrade nudge).
  - `services/containers.py`: ECS Container Insights Required, EKS Performance Optimization (scale-up = cost increase), EKS Container Insights Required.
  - `services/adapters/eks.py`: Node group DEGRADED state, under-utilized scaling config, "No Fargate profiles configured" best-practice nudge, marketplace add-on $0 review, Add-on DEGRADED state.
  - `services/adapters/aurora.py`: Clone sprawl, Global DB replica lag, Backtrack window.
  - `services/adapters/bedrock.py`: Idle Bedrock agent (AWS docs confirm agents themselves accrue no charge — hardcoded $5/month placeholder removed).
  - `services/monitoring.py`: Excessive log storage, Unused CloudWatch Alarms, Multi-Region CloudTrail, S3/Lambda Data Events trail flags, CloudTrail Insights, Multiple CloudTrail Trails.
  - `services/load_balancer.py`: Public Internal LB (security), Excessive ALB rules (no per-rule $), Unnecessary Cross-AZ LB (fake 1GB/hour baseline).
  - `services/route53.py`: Complex Routing Simple Use, Unnecessary Health Checks (generic $0.50/check, not per-account).
  - `services/step_functions.py`: Non-Prod 24/7 (percentage range).
  - `services/ebs.py`: Underutilized high-IOPS volumes flag (no-metrics fallback), Snapshot Lifecycle (DLM enablement).
  - `services/athena.py`: Query Results lifecycle nudge, Workgroup Optimization (scan limit).
  - `services/api_gateway.py`: API Gateway Caching (caching itself adds cost).
  - `services/cloudfront.py`: Disabled distribution housekeeping ($0 explicit), Origin Shield Review (net effect can go either way).
  - `services/dms.py`: DMS Serverless monitor nudge ("Variable based on usage").
  - `services/glue.py`: Crawler Optimization ("Variable based on frequency").
  - `services/msk.py`: MSK Serverless monitor nudge ("Variable based on usage").
  - `services/lambda_svc.py`: Lambda Low Invocation (no idle cost on Lambda — savings ~$0), Lambda VPC Configuration (mixed perf+cost), Lambda Reserved Concurrency (reserved concurrency itself is free).
  - `services/backup.py`: Cross-Region Backup Copies (resilience trade-off), Ephemeral Resource Backups (unquantified), Multiple Backup Plans (AWS Backup plans are free per AWS docs — only jobs cost money).
  - `services/apprunner.py`: Auto Scaling Optimization (hardcoded "$30/month potential" magic number).
  - `services/opensearch.py`: Old OpenSearch Version, Old Elasticsearch Version (engine cost identical across versions).

  Findings that survived this purge all carry one of: (1) a live `PricingEngine`-derived $ amount, (2) a per-resource `parse_dollar_savings`-extracted value, (3) a concrete formula like `(current - recommended) × per-unit-price × 730`. AWS Knowledge MCP was consulted to confirm the cost reality of five borderline cases (Bedrock agents, AWS Backup plans, VPC gateway endpoints, Lightsail bundle transfer allowance, ALB LCU pricing) before removal.

### Added
- **RDS Reserved Instance scenario matrix on every database**. The Reserved Instance Opportunities rec category in the RDS tab no longer disclose a single hard-coded `"1-yr no-upfront RI"` scenario; each candidate database now carries an `RIScenarios` list covering the full 6-cell purchase matrix (1yr / 3yr × No Upfront / Partial Upfront / All Upfront) computed via the new `RDS_RI_DISCOUNT_MATRIX` constants in `services/rds.py` against the live PricingEngine-derived on-demand baseline. The renderer (`_render_rds_ri_scenarios_table` in `reporter_phase_b.py`) emits a compact per-database table with the maximum-savings row highlighted, alongside the on-demand monthly baseline so the FinOps reader can audit the discount math.
- **Cost Optimization Hub commitment scenario matrix**. CoH-routed reservation / Savings Plan recommendations consumed by the Commitment Analysis tab via `ctx.cost_hub_splits["commitment_analysis"]` are now scaled from AWS's single recommended (term, payment_option) into the full 6-cell matrix using standard tier ratios (`_COH_COMMITMENT_TIER_RATIOS` in `reporter_phase_b.py`). Each commitment rec renders an inline scenarios table below the existing CoH summary table; the AWS-recommended scenario row is highlighted as the anchor and the others are shown as percent-delta relative to it.

### Changed
- **Compute Optimizer findings distributed into per-service tabs** (mirrors the earlier Cost Optimization Hub retirement). The standalone "Compute Optimizer" tab no longer renders. EC2 / EBS / RDS recommendations were already inline in their tabs via `services.advisor.get_<resource>_compute_optimizer_recommendations`; Lambda / ECS / ASG recommendations now flow through the corresponding per-service adapters: Lambda CO recs render inside the Lambda tab as a `compute_optimizer` source, ECS CO recs render inside the Containers tab as a `compute_optimizer` source, and ASG CO recs render inside the EC2 tab as an `asg_compute_optimizer` source. Adds `get_lambda_compute_optimizer_recommendations`, `get_ecs_compute_optimizer_recommendations`, `get_asg_compute_optimizer_recommendations` plus their normalization helpers to `services/advisor.py`. New `SOURCE_TYPE_MAP` + `PHASE_B_HANDLERS` bindings reuse the existing `_render_compute_optimizer_source` renderer because the rec schema is identical across all four resource types. Cleans up: the per-service-with-no-savings "Optimization Recommendations: 18 items / Monthly Savings: $0.00" surface that the standalone tab produced when the underlying CO recs had empty `savingsOpportunity` blocks.

### Removed
- **Cost Anomaly Detection adapter retired** from `services/__init__.py:ALL_MODULES`. The "Cost Anomaly Detection" tab no longer renders; the standalone scan path (Cost Explorer `get_anomalies` / `get_anomaly_monitors` / `get_anomaly_subscriptions` + CloudWatch `describe_alarms`) is removed entirely. The HIGH-severity risk signal in the executive summary now reads purely from priority-tagged recommendations across all surviving services rather than falling back to active-anomaly count. Deleted: `services/adapters/cost_anomaly.py`, `_render_cost_anomaly_source` in `reporter_phase_b.py`, `cost_anomaly` tab spec in `html_report_generator.py`, four `SOURCE_TYPE_MAP` + four `PHASE_B_HANDLERS` entries, golden fixture key.
- **Compute Optimizer adapter retired** from `services/__init__.py:ALL_MODULES`. Deleted: `services/adapters/compute_optimizer.py`, `compute_optimizer` tab spec in `html_report_generator.py`, golden fixture key. The legacy `(compute_optimizer, *)` `SOURCE_TYPE_MAP` and `PHASE_B_HANDLERS` entries are retained for any in-flight scan JSON that predates the retirement; new scans never emit them.
- Service count: 36 → 34 after both removals.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Design context files**: `PRODUCT.md` (strategic intent: register=product, three-deep user funnel of cloud architect / FinOps engineer / DevOps drill-down, audit-grade voice, anti-references) and `DESIGN.md` (visual system following the Google Stitch DESIGN.md format: frontmatter tokens for colors / typography / rounded / spacing / components, plus six prose sections, plus 9 Named Rules and a Do's / Don'ts forceful enough to enforce the strategic line).
- **Sidecar** `.impeccable/design.json` (schemaVersion 2): tonal ramps per color, shadow / motion / breakpoint tokens, full HTML/CSS drop-in component snippets, narrative mapping (north star, key characteristics, rules, dos, donts). Renders in the live impeccable panel.
- **Premium-paper type system**: Newsreader (display, editorial serif via Google Fonts CDN) + IBM Plex Sans (body / labels / chrome) + IBM Plex Mono (resource IDs, code). Replaces Roboto / Roboto Mono. `font-feature-settings: "ss01", "cv05"` on body, optical-sizing on Newsreader, tabular-nums on every aligned-numeric element. Print stylesheet keeps its scoped Georgia carve-out.
- **Structured executive summary**: large Newsreader figure (`$X.XX per month`, `defensibly recoverable` italic caption) followed by a three-column dl of facts (`Annual` / `Top services` / `Open risks`) with hairline dividers. Replaces the four-card grid + risks-row + prose sentence.
- **Sticky savings-sorted jump-nav rail**: left-margin aside on viewports >= 1400px, savings-descending list of services with compact dollar chips. Hover-edge auto-hide (6px sliver at rest, slides in on hover or focus-within), `prefers-reduced-motion` pins it open. `jumpToPanel()` JS helper activates the target tab via `showTab` and smooth-scrolls the panel into view.
- **Source-confidence taxonomy** (`reporter_phase_b.VALID_SOURCE_BADGES`): single enum of four labels (`Metric Backed`, `ML Backed`, `Cost Hub`, `Audit Based`) that 1:1 matches the rendered glossary. `source_type_badge` refuses to render any out-of-enum label. Each per-service group renders as a `<section class="source-section" data-source="...">` wrapper that drives a CSS `::before` typographic prefix on every nested rec-item title (`METRIC ·`, `ML ·`, `COST HUB ·`, `AUDIT ·`), retiring the chip-badge form.
- **Priority filter strip**: `Filter: All / High priority / Medium / Low` chips above the tabs. `body[data-priority-filter]` attribute selector dims non-matching `.rec-item` cards across every tab with no DOM mutation.
- **Tab strip restructured**: tabs sort by total monthly savings descending (top earners lead), tab-chip shows compact dollar amount (`$267`, `$1.2k`) instead of recommendation count, zero-savings tabs render with no chip. New `_format_savings_chip()` helper.
- **Footer scan-JSON download**: data: URL link embeds the raw scan results in the page so the report is self-contained. JSON encoder serializes datetimes via `isoformat`.
- **Reservation matrix in `commitment_analysis`**: SP and RI purchase recommendations fan out across `(1yr, 3yr) × (No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront)` per type/service. Each rec carries explicit `term` and `payment_option` fields and renders as `Action: SP Purchase Recommendation (1yr, All Upfront)`. Each call is independent; one denial does not kill the others. Ships disabled-friendly: degrades cleanly under CE access-deny.
- **Hover-edge handle on the jump-nav rail**: a 3 × 32 px vertical bar in `--text-secondary` at 35% opacity hints at the sliver's presence; fades on expand.
- **`logger` setup** in `services/containers.py` so ECS cluster diagnostics use `logger.debug` instead of fifty per-cluster `print()` lines per scan.

### Changed
- **Cost Optimization Hub adapter retired** from `services/__init__.py:ALL_MODULES` (replaced by per-service distribution). The standalone "Cost Optimization Hub" tab no longer exists. `ScanOrchestrator._prefetch_advisor_data` now extends its `type_map` to bucket `EcsService` / `EcsTask` / `EcsCluster` into `containers` and every `*ReservedInstances` / `*SavingsPlans` into `commitment_analysis`. Unbucketed types are surfaced via `ctx.warn` so the map can be extended deliberately.
- **`containers.py` adapter** now consumes `ctx.cost_hub_splits["containers"]` and renders the recommendations as a `cost_optimization_hub` source alongside its enhanced checks.
- **`commitment_analysis.py` adapter** now consumes `ctx.cost_hub_splits["commitment_analysis"]` for CoH-curated SP / RI purchase recs, rendered alongside its CE-API-derived utilization and coverage data.
- **HTML report visual baseline**: header is now flat (no linear-gradient, no radial halo, no glassmorphism); recommendation cards use full hairline borders with priority encoded as a leading `::before` badge (`High priority`, `Medium priority`, `Low priority`) instead of a 4px colored side-stripe; info / warning / success / opportunity callouts use full 1px borders in the semantic color rather than left-stripes; hover states shift border color or background tone only (no `translateY`, no shadow upgrade); motion easing on every transition is `var(--ease-out-quart)` = `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` rather than Material's `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`; badge tonal pairs are tokenized into `--badge-{success,warning,danger,info}-{fg,bg}` for both light and dark themes; scrollbar thumb and `top-buckets-table h4` use neutral colors rather than `--primary` (Status-Channel Rule).
- **Heading outline** repaired across the report: stat-card labels emit `<div class="stat-label">` instead of `<h4>`, recommendation group titles emit `<h4>` instead of `<h5>`, and the hidden SVG sprite has `aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"`. 26 detector skipped-heading findings cleared.
- **Snapshot rollup deduplication**: `_render_ebs_enhanced_checks` skips snapshot CheckCategories so the same SnapshotId is rendered once in the dedicated Snapshots tab rather than once per CheckCategory in EBS plus again in Snapshots.

### Fixed
- **`html_report_generator._get_footer` datetime crash**: `json.dumps(scan_results)` now passes a `default=` serializer that ISO-formats datetimes and falls back to `str()` for any exotic type. The whole block is wrapped in `try / except` so even a worst-case serialization failure just omits the download link rather than aborting report generation.
- **Cost Anomaly adapter parameter rename**: `DateRange` -> `DateInterval` on `ce.get_anomalies` per the current Cost Explorer SDK. Anomaly recommendations now actually surface (when permissions allow) instead of being silently dropped by validation.
- **Source-confidence prefix glyph**: `\\00b7` CSS escape was being parsed by Python as octal NUL (`\\x00`) followed by literal `b7`, producing `METRIC \\x00b7` in the emitted CSS. Switched to the literal `·` (U+00B7) character; the HTML document is UTF-8 and the byte sequence survives the round trip cleanly.
- **Source-confidence taxonomy drift**: legacy "Static Analysis" label retired in favor of "Audit Based" (which is what the glossary defines). All `SOURCE_TYPE_MAP` and `_GENERIC_SOURCE_TYPES` entries renamed; `source_type_badge` enforces the four-label enum at render time.
- **ECS cluster Debug noise**: 50+ `print(f"Debug: Cluster X...")` lines per scan demoted to `logger.debug()` so default scan output stays terse.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **46 audit remediations** across 8 waves from `AUDIT_REPORT.md` code audit:
  - W1 (7): Critical crash in `html_report_generator.py` (KeyError), wrong dollar values in `cost_anomaly.py`, `opensearch.py`, `ebs.py`, `file_systems.py`, `lambda_svc.py`, `network_cost.py`
  - W2 (8): Contract key mismatches in `optimization_descriptions` across 7 adapters (`ebs`, `ami`, `dynamodb`, `eks`, `dms`, `s3`, `cloudfront`) and summary count in `compute_optimizer.py`
  - W3 (3): Missing client declarations in `elasticache`, `mediastore`, `network` adapters
  - W4 (10): Missing `reads_fast_mode` class attributes in 10 adapters
  - W5 (5): Pagination gaps in `commitment_analysis` (4 CE APIs), `cost_anomaly` (2 APIs), `monitoring`, `aurora`, `sagemaker` (2 APIs)
  - W6 (3): Silent `except: pass` blocks replaced with warning logs; legacy calls wrapped; `rds.py` narrowed exception scope
  - W7 (6): XSS fix via `html.escape()` in report generator, `deepcopy` for source mutation, comma-safe savings parsing, `logging.warning()` replacing `print()`, service count card fix, `json.dumps` for chartData
  - W8 (4): `datetime.utcnow()` → `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`, magic numbers → named constants, `parse_dollar_savings` percentage fallback
- **4 post-fix corrections**: `opensearch.py` (live pricing path ×2), `ebs.py` (live pricing path ×1), `compute_optimizer.py` (summary count) — all now apply `ctx.pricing_multiplier` consistently on both live and fallback pricing paths
- **Cost Optimization Hub double-counting**: Replaced fabricated `_ROUTED_TYPES` strings (`Ec2InstanceRightsizing` etc.) with correct `_ROUTED_RESOURCE_TYPES` using real AWS API `currentResourceType` values (`Ec2Instance`, `EbsVolume`, `LambdaFunction`, `RdsDbInstance`)
- **EKS/EC2 triple-counting**: Added `_is_eks_managed_instance()` helper in `services/ec2.py` to skip EKS-managed nodes in `get_enhanced_ec2_checks()` and `get_advanced_ec2_checks()`, eliminating overlap with `eks.py` and `containers.py` adapters

- **Tab Visibility**: Services with 0 recommendations automatically hidden from tabs

### Fixed - IAM Policy
- **Complete Permissions**: Added missing elasticloadbalancingv2 permissions for ALB/NLB
- **S3 Multipart Uploads**: Added s3:ListMultipartUploads permission
- **Explicit Permissions**: Replaced wildcards with specific EC2/RDS permissions
- **IAM Policy**: Updated permission coverage for supported services

### Fixed - Documentation
- **Service Filtering**: Updated count from 25 to 30 categories (added CloudFront, API Gateway, Step Functions)
- **Documentation Updates**: Aligned README and architecture notes with current service coverage
- **Cost Model**: Documented heuristic estimation approach and limitations

### Fixed - Code Quality
- **Deprecation Warning**: Replaced datetime.utcnow() with timezone-aware datetime.now(timezone.utc)
- **Duplicate Removal**: Removed duplicate "Additional Services" container (API Gateway/Step Functions)
- **Indentation Errors**: Fixed mediastore_findings and total_savings calculation
- **Orphaned Code**: Removed duplicate step_functions_checks assignment

### Technical Improvements
- **Service Filtering Logic**: Normalized service names to lowercase before comparison
- **Recommendation Counting**: Fixed len() calls on dict vs list inconsistencies
- **HTML Generator**: Added Lightsail, DMS, Glue, Redshift to grouped services skip lists
- **Service Map**: Now includes 30 filterable services (was 25)
